Pardon the crappy code

## Getting started:
1. Install the React Native CLI (not the Expo CLI) using these instructions: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#content
2. Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DevelynSeventh.git```
3. Run ```npm install``` inside the root directory
4. Use ```react-native run-android``` or ```react-native run-ios``` inn the root directory for android and ios respectively.

## ToDo: 
### Teacher pages:
- [ ] ***UPDATE ALL OF THE "VIET" TEACHER REFERENCES WITH WHOEVER'S SIGNED IN***

- [ ] Notify teacher when they set their limit below the current amount of people already signed up
